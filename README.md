# Project Description
This project implements a basic MapReduce framework using Operating System concepts, designed to simulate parallel and distributed data processing on a single machine. It explores the Map and Reduce phases, allowing students to understand concurrent computing and synchronization mechanisms in the context of parallel processing.

# Key Features
  -  Map Phase: Processes input data in parallel, producing intermediate key-value pairs.
  -  Shuffle Phase: Groups key-value pairs by key, preparing the data for reduction.
  -  Reduce Phase: Aggregates values associated with each key, generating the final result.

# Concepts Used
  -  Threading and Synchronization: Efficient management of concurrent tasks during the Map and Reduce phases.
  -  File Handling: Reading input and managing outputs.
  -  Inter-thread Communication: Passing data between Map and Reduce phases using shared data structures.
